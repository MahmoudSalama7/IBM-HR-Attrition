# IBM-HR-Employees-Attrition

Project Overview
The HR Employees' Attrition Analysis project aims to analyze employee attrition data to understand the factors influencing employee turnover. The project utilizes data analysis techniques and visualizations to provide insights that can help HR departments make informed decisions about employee retention strategies.

Objectives
Data Analysis: Analyze employee attrition data to identify key factors contributing to employee turnover.
Visualization: Create interactive dashboards to visualize attrition trends, patterns, and correlations.
Insights: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on data analysis.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including features related to employee demographics, job roles, tenure, and other relevant factors. The dataset is intended to be analyzed to predict and understand employee attrition.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Analyze data distribution, summary statistics, and relationships between features.
